Enemy can function one of two ways:

1. Simply make the pieces join end to end to form a wall. Wall would be destroyable by hitting the end of it that has the eye open,
rest of the wall would block shots. Allows us to get a little creative with level design and thinking about how the players would be 
able to destroy the wall.

2. We give it the ability to automatically grow itself the longer it is onscreen. The current frames of animation would allow the enemy
to randomly select the direction to expand in (probably something like a 50% chance of continuing forward and a 25% chance of picking 
either direction)and the animation would play that grows it in the respective direction. Animation timing would be something like this:
>start off with Wall B
>(wall B picks a direction after a few moments) Wall B changes to Wall 1 of whichever direction it decides to go, maybe it blinks 
twice before expanding to signal the player.
>Frames for wall 2-4 play out normally.
>when Wall 5 starts, it spawns a new Frame B to continue the wall.
>Once that Wall B has picked a direction and started up its animation, the previous animation follows, so a successful run would look like:
  
  Wall B
  Wall L1
  Wall L2
  Wall L3
  Wall L4
  Wall L5, New Wall B Created
  [brief pause while new wall B decides path]
  Wall L5, Wall F1
  Wall L6, Wall F2
  Wall L7, Wall F3
  FINISHED, Wall F4
  etc.
  
Not sure how hard it would be to program this sort of growth mechanic into the enemy, but its there if someone wants to give it a shot. '
Otherwise, we can just stick to option 1 and leave it as a basic destructable wall.
