Bacteria B is really simple. 

Bacteria B always faces either left or right, but can still move up and down similar to Capi. It is a shooting bacteria, and it will
either follow a set path and shoot at a certain interval or it will attempt to line up a shot at Capi depending on whichever's easier.

When moving up or down, the capsule shifts to the relevant movement frame.
When shooting, its shooting animation that matches its current movement frame plays for a second while the blast is fired.
